That expression on your face...you seem lost. Your day hasn't been going too well, my friend, has it?
Been wandering around all lost and scared. You're as pale as a ghost!
You're looking at me like I'm going to attack you any minute! Relax, chap. All is good. Little old me is no threat to you.
Truth be told, I'm as lost as you are. No idea where I am. Been running through these halls for god knows how long without a way out.
You and I are not too different in that regard! But you're more lost than I. So how about I explain a thing or two, hm?
You see, this house is moving all the time. It's like a huge, shifting machine. Even I don't know how many rooms there are. Whenever some time passes, the rooms will rearrange.
If you're looking for the exit, you best do it before this bloody building decides to change its mind again. It's quite the maze, and dangerous, I guess. But you'll get the hang of it again.
Maybe we'll see each other at the end. Take care until then, alright? 


Thank the heavens you are here!
I don't think I could have held on for much longer... all of a sudden, the floor just gave out from underneath me!
Quick, old chap, help me up, won't you?
